# Intro

## About me

First of all, I would like to tell you a little about myself. I think I was about twelve when I discovered my preference for BDSM. I didn't know what to do with it at the time and it took me years to understand what it was all about. As I've always had an affinity for technology, I was able to search for information on the internet early on. In those days I was still using a modem and typically had an AOL connection. Most of the sites that contained useful information were written in English. That meant I had to translate a lot of things with a dictionary. There was also virtually no protection for minors. A lot of what I saw and read back then was really formative and incredibly new to me. As I got older and grew up, I realized that BDSM is not just a preference or an inclination, it is part of my personality and my character. It's a very big "piece" of me.

Coming out in the classic sense was extremely difficult at the time. It felt like nobody in my circle of friends could really relate to it. Over the years, I closed myself off more and more. Even today, decades later, I still encounter harsh rejection. I lost many of my friends because I opened up. So I learned very early on to hide my real self.

Today, I am on my way to slowly shedding my closed-mindedness. Out of pure conviction that there are more people in the world who "tick" like me, I have decided to write these pages. I deliberately want to go public with this information!

## How did I come to Self Bondage?

At the time, and still today, it is appealing for me to put myself in a situation in which I can no longer easily free myself. As I didn't have a partner as a top to play with, this was the only way to live out my kinks. In many respects, there are differences to a session with a play partner. Depending on the personal kinks of each individual. 

My motivation: I can live out my secret needs without going public. Which has turned out to be a fallacy over the years! Much of what I want and what has developed over the years can be lived out. But simply not everything!

At the time, I spent a long time looking for a way

- how to create a controllable situation
- with very few unknowns
- with the greatest possible safety
- maintaining and artificially inducing most of my kinks

Please read on...


## How did I arrive at a technique that I found acceptable?

When I completed my first vocational training as an industrial technician, I actually thought about combining BDSM and technology for the first time. It must have been around 1999-2000. I didn't know anything about self bondage back then. But I realized that I was looking for a way to deal with my desires. How could I tie myself up and release myself in a controlled way without taking any risks? A difficult and almost impossible task for me at the time.

By this time, the first forums had begun to report on it. Many had discovered the ice castle for themselves. Once the ice had melted, you were free. I couldn't and still can't do anything with it. I lack security and control. So I had to keep working my brain.

Through my apprenticeship, I joined a southern German car manufacturer. I worked in maintenance at the plant. It was amazing! I was just 20 years old. I accompanied production there. I noticed that the fire doors were held automatically. They were closed in the event of a fire alarm. Interesting? Definitely - these doors in the factory were very heavy. I took a closer look and realized that they were electrically operated magnets. If the supply voltage was lost (or in the event of a fire alarm), they lost their holding force and the doors closed. Fantastic! That could be an approach!

Ergo: I had bought several electrically operated magnets. At that time, these special components were usually already available in fire protection supplies. But I wanted the individual parts and, out of necessity, had to register with a store for automation components. I found what I was looking for there.

Now I had tested how high the holding force would have to be to keep my arms fixed. A lot of things went wrong. When I pulled the anchor plates (the metal plates that function as counterparts) to the side, the magnetic effect simply disappeared.

## Next...

The technology kept me going. I simply knew that I had to keep going. In the course of my early career, I got to know more and more colleagues who were simply the best in their respective fields. That spurred me on to keep going.

More knowledge. More experience. So I continued with my training in electrical engineering, automation and computer science. During my studies, I finally had the idea of using a PLC to control the electromagnets. This was the first generation of my completely self-developed, built and programmed controllers for self bondage. We are now in the 2003s and it was the start of my first session, which I started completely on my own, without any outside help.

## That was the beginning of my project

Around 2002 was the birth of my own technical creation that has been developed, built and tested over the decades. Everything I have achieved to date is based on these ideas and thoughts.

## What can you expect here?

I want you to be part of it. I write openly and honestly about my experiences and developments over the years.

This is now the fifth generation of my self bondage developments. It feels like a lot has happened since these many years of beginnings! The project has grown up and is quite impressive. I have invested a lot of time and energy. In the meantime, the name __Self Bondage Control__ has emerged.

I also created a logo for the project that makes the connection between BDSM and technology:

## Remote

I am currently working on a "very" secure way of transferring the controls to another person in manual mode via the Internet. As this is at a very early stage and therefore by no means ready for use, I will provide this information later. Please be patient.

## Safty

I used the English word on purpose. I don't see any real distinction between Safty and Security in German. 

It is very important to me that all developments take place within a framework that represents the minimum of safety for me. __I never intended and never intend to put my life in danger.__ I have thus ruled out some kinks, as tempting as they are.

__Everyone is responsible for their own safety and inviolability. Before you experiment with self bondage, you should be aware of what can happen in the worst case scenario. I have therefore dedicated a separate chapter to this topic.__ 

__There is no such thing as absolute safety!__ 

To read/edge note: autoerotic accidents / fatalities.
