"Topping" refers to being the dominant partner in sex. The designated top takes control of the act and
commands the designated bottom to abide by their will.

We now move to the right side. For this, I designed the software to be completely modular. It has five options, three of which currently exist.

* `sbc` - Self Bondage Control
* `rbc` - Remote Bondage Control
* `live` - Live Session
* `setup` - [Manual operation of the modules](/en/topping/setup)
* `cli` - Command Line Tool (Database)
