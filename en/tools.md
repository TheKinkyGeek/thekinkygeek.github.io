# Tools

It is very important for me to emphasize that everything that is being developed here, or has already been developed, is based on free and open-source software! All the projects, tools, frameworks, programming languages, and much more that I use here—please consider yourselves deeply honored. To all those who dedicate their free time to these projects—regardless of whether there is any economic interest or not:

::: tip THANK YOU
I would like to express my sincere and most respectful thanks to you all! Without your groundwork, this would never have been possible.

This list is almost certainly not yet complete:

- **Fedora** 42/43 <https://www.fedoraproject.org/>  
  This has become my favorite operating system. It's great not only for development, but also for almost all my daily tasks. Stable and secure!
- **KDE** <https://kde.org/>  
  One of the most magnificent surfaces I have ever seen.
- **Eclipse IDE** <https://eclipseide.org/>  
  The firmware for the modules was primarily developed here.
- **AVR Dudes**: <https://github.com/avrdudes> / <https://github.com/avrdudes/avr-libc>  
  The firmware of all modules is based on the free AVR toolchain, including the associated bintools and libraries.
- **Visual Studio Code** <https://code.visualstudio.com/>
  Everything else will be edited here. :)
- **KiCad** <https://www.kicad.org/>  
  All PCBs and panels originate here.
- **OpenSCAD** <https://openscad.org/>  
  Every 3D drawing was developed with OpenSCAD.
- **CAN Bus Bootloader**: <https://github.com/crycode-de/mcp-can-boot> / <https://github.com/crycode-de/mcp-can-boot-flash-app>  
  I have no idea how much time this project has saved me. But it certainly was and is a lot.
- **Hardware** (only) <https://www.arduino.cc/>  
  I am grateful for the Arduino Nano and Arduino Mega hardware designs. They have allowed me to dedicate a significant amount of time to other tasks.
- **VitePress** <https://vitepress.dev/>
  This page exists because of VitePress.
