I think I was about twelve when I discovered my preference for BDSM. I didn&#39;t know what to do with it at the time and it took me years to understand what it was all about. As I&#39;ve always had an affinity for technology, I was able to search for information on the internet early on. In those days I was still using a modem and typically had an AOL connection. Most of the sites that contained useful information were written in English. That meant I had to translate a lot of things with a dictionary. There was also virtually no protection for minors. A lot of what I saw and read back then was really formative and incredibly new to me. As I got older and grew up, I realized that BDSM is not just a preference or an inclination, it is part of my personality and my character. It&#39;s a very big &quot;piece&quot; of me.</p><p>Coming out in the classic sense was extremely difficult at the time. It felt like nobody in my circle of friends could really relate to it. Over the years, I closed myself off more and more. Even today, decades later, I still encounter harsh rejection. I lost many of my friends because I opened up. So I learned very early on to hide my real self.</p><p>Today, I am on my way to slowly shedding my closed-mindedness. Out of pure conviction that there are more people in the world who &quot;tick&quot; like me, I have decided to write these pages. I deliberately want to go public with this information!</p><h2 id="how-did-i-come-to-self-bondage" tabindex="-1">How did I come to Self Bondage? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-i-come-to-self-bondage" aria-label="Permalink to “How did I come to Self Bondage?”">​</a></h2><p>At the time, and still today, it is appealing for me to put myself in a situation in which I can no longer easily free myself. As I didn&#39;t have a partner as a top to play with, this was the only way to live out my kinks. In many respects, there are differences to a session with a play partner. Depending on the personal kinks of each individual.</p><p>My motivation: I can live out my secret needs without going public. Which has turned out to be a fallacy over the years! Much of what I want and what has developed over the years can be lived out. But simply not everything!</p><p>At the time, I spent a long time looking for a way</p><ul><li>how to create a controllable situation</li><li>with very few unknowns</li><li>with the greatest possible safety</li><li>maintaining and artificially inducing most of my kinks</li></ul><p>Please read on...</p><h2 id="how-did-i-arrive-at-a-technique-that-i-found-acceptable" tabindex="-1">How did I arrive at a technique that I found acceptable? <a class="header-anchor" href="#how-did-i-arrive-at-a-technique-that-i-found-acceptable" aria-label="Permalink to “How did I arrive at a technique that I found acceptable?”">​</a></h2><p>When I completed my first vocational training as an industrial technician, I actually thought about combining BDSM and technology for the first time. It must have been around 1999-2000. I didn&#39;t know anything about self bondage back then. But I realized that I was looking for a way to deal with my desires. How could I tie myself up and release myself in a controlled way without taking any risks? A difficult and almost impossible task for me at the time.</p><p>By this time, the first forums had begun to report on it. Many had discovered the ice castle for themselves. Once the ice had melted, you were free. I couldn&#39;t and still can&#39;t do anything with it. I lack security and control. So I had to keep working my brain.</p><p>Through my apprenticeship, I joined a southern German car manufacturer. I worked in maintenance at the plant. It was amazing! I was just 20 years old. I accompanied production there. I noticed that the fire doors were held automatically. They were closed in the event of a fire alarm. Interesting? Definitely - these doors in the factory were very heavy. I took a closer look and realized that they were electrically operated magnets. If the supply voltage was lost (or in the event of a fire alarm), they lost their holding force and the doors closed. Fantastic! That could be an approach!</p><p>Ergo: I had bought several electrically operated magnets. At that time, these special components were usually already available in fire protection supplies. But I wanted the individual parts and, out of necessity, had to register with a store for automation components. I found what I was looking for there.</p><p>Now I had tested how high the holding force would have to be to keep my arms fixed. A lot of things went wrong. When I pulled the anchor plates (the metal plates that function as counterparts) to the side, the magnetic effect simply disappeared.</p><h2 id="next" tabindex="-1">Next... <a class="header-anchor" href="#next" aria-label="Permalink to “Next...”">​</a></h2><p>The technology kept me going. I simply knew that I had to keep going. In the course of my early career, I got to know more and more colleagues who were simply the best in their respective fields. That spurred me on to keep going.</p><p>More knowledge. More experience. So I continued with my training in electrical engineering, automation and computer science. During my studies, I finally had the idea of using a PLC to control the electromagnets. This was the first generation of my completely self-developed, built and programmed controllers for self bondage. We are now in the 2003s and it was the start of my first session, which I started completely on my own, without any outside help.</p><h2 id="that-was-the-beginning-of-my-project" tabindex="-1">That was the beginning of my project <a class="header-anchor" href="#that-was-the-beginning-of-my-project" aria-label="Permalink to “That was the beginning of my project”">​</a></h2><p>Around 2002 was the birth of my own technical creation that has been developed, built and tested over the decades. Everything I have achieved to date is based on these ideas and thoughts.</p><h2 id="what-can-you-expect-here" tabindex="-1">What can you expect here? <a class="header-anchor" href="#what-can-you-expect-here" aria-label="Permalink to “What can you expect here?”">​</a></h2><p>I want you to be part of it. I write openly and honestly about my experiences and developments over the years.</p><p>This is now the fifth generation of my self bondage developments. It feels like a lot has happened since these many years of beginnings! The project has grown up and is quite impressive. I have invested a lot of time and energy. In the meantime, the name <strong>Self Bondage Control</strong> has emerged.</p><p>I also created a logo for the project that makes the connection between BDSM and technology:</p><p><a href="/images/logo_gen2_dark_1024.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+i+'" alt="Logo" width="300" class="light-only" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a><a href="/images/logo_gen2_white_1024.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+r+'" alt="Logo" width="300" class="dark-only" style="display:block;margin:0 auto;"></a></p><h2 id="remote" tabindex="-1">Remote <a class="header-anchor" href="#remote" aria-label="Permalink to “Remote”">​</a></h2><p>I am currently working on a &quot;very&quot; secure way of transferring the controls to another person in manual mode via the Internet. As this is at a very early stage and therefore by no means ready for use, I will provide this information later. Please be patient.</p><h2 id="safty" tabindex="-1">Safty <a class="header-anchor" href="#safty" aria-label="Permalink to “Safty”">​</a></h2><p>I used the English word on purpose. I don&#39;t see any real distinction between Safty and Security in German.</p><p>It is very important to me that all developments take place within a framework that represents the minimum of safety for me. <strong>I never intended and never intend to put my life in danger.</strong> I have thus ruled out some kinks, as tempting as they are.</p><p><strong>Everyone is responsible for their own safety and inviolability. Before you experiment with self bondage, you should be aware of what can happen in the worst case scenario. I have therefore dedicated a separate chapter to this topic.</strong></p><p><strong>There is no such thing as absolute safety!</strong></p><p>To read/edge note: autoerotic accidents / fatalities.</p>',35)])])}const u=t(s,[["render",l]]);export{y as __pageData,u as default};
