These are really good in terms of current handling capacity. Each module can therefore have its own power supply. Since each module is equipped with a mainboard, I also distributed the 5V supply to each XLR connector.</p><p>Furthermore, each module has a connection to GND/PE (bridged here). This primarily serves as protection. Finally, the power supply module is connected to 230V mains voltage.</p><p>There is one disadvantage, however: If a module requires both voltage ranges (24V and 12V), two power supply lines would have to be connected. This hasn&#39;t been necessary so far – but perhaps it will be in the future...?</p><p><a href="/images/modules/supply/supply_8.jpg" target="_blank"><img src="'+n+'" alt="Supply 8"></a></p><h2 id="engineering-adapter" tabindex="-1">Engineering Adapter <a class="header-anchor" href="#engineering-adapter" aria-label="Permalink to “Engineering Adapter”">​</a></h2><p><a href="/images/modules/supply/supply_engadapter_board.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+i+'" alt="Supply Engineering Adapter Board"></a></p><p><a href="/images/modules/supply/supply_engadapter_schematic.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+u+'" alt="Supply Engineering Adapter Schematic"></a></p><h2 id="case" tabindex="-1">Case <a class="header-anchor" href="#case" aria-label="Permalink to “Case”">​</a></h2><p><a href="/images/modules/supply/supply_frontpanel.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+d+'" alt="Supply Frontpanel"></a></p><p><a href="/images/modules/supply/supply_backpanel.png" target="_blank"><img src="'+h+'" alt="Supply Frontpanel"></a></p><h2 id="outlook" tabindex="-1">Outlook <a class="header-anchor" href="#outlook" aria-label="Permalink to “Outlook”">​</a></h2><p>One possible evolutionary step would be voltage and current monitoring of the individual power supplies.
